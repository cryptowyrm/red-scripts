# red-scripts

An assortment of scripts I've written using the [Red programming language](https://www.red-lang.org), a full stack language that is as easy to use as a high level language like Python but creates fully native console (Mac, Win & Linux) and GUI (Mac & Win) apps and can even be used for low level driver development using its Red/System DSL.

Check out my Red programming guide [Learning Red](https://crypticwyrm.neocities.org/learningred/) if you want to learn the language.
